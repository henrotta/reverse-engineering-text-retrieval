## 📣 Description

This application enables to reverse-engineer a microservices architecture from a data perspective.

## ⭐ Features

Here is a summary of the features currently supported.

### Static Analysis by Heuristics

#### Description

The static analysis feature enables the developer to (1) retrieve one or more GitHub/GitLab microservices, (2) statically analyze them, (3) identify data access code fragments linked to certain API or database technologies and likely to change during the evolution phase, implying then the propagation of changes in components
(e.g. other microservices or databases), (4) extract thanks to NLP the data concepts of those data access code fragments, (5) link the data access code fragments with related data concepts, (6) compare data concepts with other ones in the same microservice, (7) associate same data concepts, (8) present the result as a report, in a defined model, designed to help developers understand microservices in a conceptual data approach, so that they can pay attention to them when co-evolving API and database accesses. This report aims to provide developers with a valuable basis for software evolution tasks, such as re-documentation, visualization, quality assessment, improvement recommendations, impact analysis, or change propagation.

Here is a summary of languages and technologies currently supported:

#### Implementation status

| Language              | Technology                        | Implementation status |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | MongoDB <br/> Redis <br/> Express | 🌕 <br/> 🌕 <br/> 🌕  |

#### How to?

**INPUT**

Invoke the static analysis by using the [POST /static/language/:language/repository/zip](http://locahost:3000/static/language/:language/repository/zip) root with a ZIP file inside the request as a form-data with the key `file` and the ZIP file as value, and not as a binary file.
This zip file can be generated from GitHub/GitLab repositories thanks to [DENIM Downloading](https://github.com/DatabaseEvolutionNudgeInMicroservices/downloading).

⚠️ This can take a while depending on the repository size.
⚠️ All repositories to analyze have to be integrated in the ZIP file.
⚠️ Each directory at the root of the zip file represents a repository.

**OUTPUT**

Consult the response object:

```json

### Static Analysis by NLP

#### Description

The NLP concept extraction approach enables the developer to (1) retrieve one or more microservices from a codebase, (2)
perform lexical and statistical analysis to extract candidate business concepts from source files, (3) filter and
prioritize these concepts using relevance metrics such as TF-IDF and dominance (4) use these high-level
business concepts as anchors to locate related code fragments, including those that access APIs or databases, (5) compare concept occurrences and usage
across different files and components, (6) reveal indirect or implicit dependencies between business logic and data
access code, and (7) present the result as a report, in a defined model, designed to help developers understand
microservices in a conceptual data approach, so that they can pay attention to them when co-evolving API and database
accesses. This report aims to provide developers with a valuable basis for software evolution tasks, such as
re-documentation, visualization, quality assessment, improvement recommendations, impact analysis, or change
propagation.

Here is a summary of languages and technologies currently supported:

#### Implementation status

| Language              | Technology | Implementation status |
| --------------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | Any        | 🌕                    |

#### How to?

****INPUT****

Invoke the static analysis by using
the [POST /static/nlp/language/:language/repository/zip](http://locahost:3000/static/language/:language/repository/zip) root
with a ZIP file inside the request.
WARNING: This can take a while depending on the repository size.
All repositories to analyze have to be integrated in the ZIP file.
Each directory at the root of the zip file represents a repository.

This zip file can be generated from GitHub/GitLab repositories thanks
to [DENIM Downloading](https://github.com/DatabaseEvolutionNudgeInMicroservices/downloading).

An optional concepts file can be provided to guide the clustering algorithm in deciding whether a file should be classified as a data-access file.
This input file must follow the structure below:

```json
  {
    "<project_name>": {
      // List of concepts that are related to the business domain (ex: table and column names from DB schema of the project)
      "data_concepts": [
        <list of domain related concepts>
      ],

      // Optional
      // List of concepts that the file should contain at list one element to be considered as data access related
      "anchor_points": [
        <list of anchor points>
      ],
    }
  }
```

Here is an example of such file:

```json
{
  "cinema-microservice-master": {
    "data_concepts": [
      "cinema",
      "movie",
      "payment",
      "ticket",
      "booking"
    ]
  },
  "comments-api-master": {
    "anchor_points": [
      "express",
      "db"
    ],
    "data_concepts": [
      "comment",
      "author",
      "createdOn",
      "hash",
      "id",
      "modifiedOn",
      "postId",
      "published",
      "replyToId",
      "source",
      "ip",
      "browser",
      "referrer",
      "text"
    ]
  }
```

****OUTPUT****

The same as in Static analysis by Heuristics.

## 🧪 Design details

### Static Analysis

For finding locations of code related to some API or database technologies, some heuristics are defined based on
pattern and rules matching according to the documentation of the technologies. These help to compute the likelihood
scores.

## 📊 Evaluation

The complete data of our evaluation is detailed in the [`/evaluation`](https://github.com/DatabaseEvolutionNudgeInMicroservices/reverse-engineering/tree/main/evaluation) folder. The `1-Ground truth <system name>.xlsx` files details the manual annotation performed on the system codebases. The `2-Actual <system name>.xlsx` file details the results of the empirical evaluation, for example in terms of precision and recall. The script `index.js` with files `3-expected <system name>.csv` and `4-actual <system name>.csv` help to compute precision and recall scores. The `4-actual <system name>.json` show examples of final reports according to the model. Files `5-<...>...` contains charts and metrics.
